## Introduction
This is a simple text editor app that can function both online and offline. It uses a variety of data persistence options to ensure that data is not lost in any scenario. The application first looks to use the data in the indexedDB to populate the editor, then if it cannot access that, it will use local storage. For offline use, this application can be downloaded to your desktop as an application. This application is helpful to developers because they can use this as a scratch pad for code snippets and coding ideas.

## User Story
